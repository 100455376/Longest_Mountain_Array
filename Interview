Interviewer: Hello! We will cover one problem today related to finding longest mountain in given array.

Programmer: Hello. That is great. May you explain problem a bit more?

Interviewer: Yes, you are given an array composed of integers and you need to find the length of the longest subarray in that array that is forming a mountain. By mountain we understand as a subarray where there is a peak element, i.e. there is one strictly lower value before it and one strictly lower value after it.

Programmer: Perfect, understood. I guess then that the minimum length must be 3 elements, and we would return 0 in other case.

Interviewer: Yeah, that is absolutely correct! What approach would you follow to solve this problem?
